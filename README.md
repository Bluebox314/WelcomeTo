# Overview
This project is a computer version of the Welcome To board game, currently a work in progress regarding fully automated function and tutorials. Current functionality allows for the program's use as a reusable paper board, with all scoring and input manually completed. The deck of cards required to play Welcome To is also included in the program.

# How to Run
This project was placed in this repository partially complete, and as a result no previous recorded versions exist. Rather than editing most of the code to create an "older version" which runs with little functionality, I've opted to ommit a runnable release until the project reaches a usable state. If you wish to run the project in it's current state, you could copy the entire project folder into an IDE (I used eclipse making this) and run from there, or copy paste code from the contained .java files and run the project yourself.
