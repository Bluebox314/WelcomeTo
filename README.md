# WelcomeTo
This project is a computer version of the Welcome To board game, currently a work in progress regarding fully automated function and tutorials. Current functionality allows for the program's use as a reusable paper board, with all scoring and input manually completed. The deck of cards required to play Welcome To is also included in the program.
